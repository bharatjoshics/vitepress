# Event Modifiers
Event modifiers in vue modify how events triggers the running of methods and help us handle events in a more efficient and straight-forward way.

Event modifiers are used together with the vue v-on directive.

## Example
- v-on:submit.prevent -> It prevents the default submit behaviour of HTML forms.
- v-on:click.once -> Make sure that an event can only run once after the page is loaded.

There are many others modifiers available. Checkout <a href="vuejs.org/guide/essentials/event-handling#event-modifiers">this</a> for more information.
